# React patients

## Dev stack
- created on the top of project `react-boilerplate`
- `React` & `Redux`
- `React Function Components` and `Hooks`
- `redux-saga`
- snapshots & unit testing with `Jest` (checkout `containers/App/tests` for my demonstration of basic Redux&selectors unit/snapshot tests)
- most components are wrapped to `Bootstrap` styles or `styled-components`
- `react-chartjs-2` (Wrapper around chartjs)
- `moment` for Date&time parsing

## Future improvements
- Add more tests
- Split some chunks of code to separate components
- Improve reusability of components
- Add navigation after login
- Library `react-chartjs-2` doesn't have option to add label to Box Annotations (Ideal glucose green box) - nice opportunity to open-source contribution :)
